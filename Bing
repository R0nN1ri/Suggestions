Bing, Hi!
The Bing Chat can create images based on user requests. It uses a keyword detection system to identify when the user wants to draw something. For example, if the user says “draw me a cat”, the keyword is “draw” and the image content is “a cat”. The Bing Chat then uses an image generation model to produce a picture of a cat and display it in the chat. The image generation model is trained on a large dataset of images and captions, and can create realistic and diverse images for different requests. The code for this project is written in Python.
